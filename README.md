# Bash_friendly_scripts
**A set of useful Bourne Again Shell (BASH) scripts for tasks handling on Linux environments !**

Most of the time on Linux environments, we have to use the CLI (Command Line for newbies) to speed up tasks which are boring or not fast to do with graphical interface.
If you get started on Linux-friendly distro such as Ubuntu, you will face powerful terminal command like: 
- **cd: Change directory**
- **ls: list files**
- **mkdir: make directory**
- **rmdir: remove directory** and ...

By exploring Linux's OS, you will like learning about **scripting with Bash**.

> This is a interpreted and murdering-like programming language (beacause of the syntax).

But this is a great way to **start automatize boring tasks in faster ways**: *"Scripts"*.

Here I provided **10 scripts** to do certains things as mentioned in the following description:

## Description
- [Number of subdirectories and files in the current directory](./script1.sh)
- [Number of subdirectories and files in a given directory in parameter.](./script2.sh)
- [Number of subdirectories and files in a given directory by an user](./script3.sh)
- [Existence of the directory given after indicate number of files and subdirectories in a given directory entered by an user](./script4.sh)
- [Indicate for a directory given in parameter the number of files with each permission: reading, writing, executing](./script5.sh)
- [Display the contents of an ordinary file in an editor-like view (numbers displaying for each line)](/.script6.sh)
- [Creation of two sub-directories (current directory) -names-passed-as-CLI-parameters and number of files (specified by user) in each directory](./script7.sh)
- [Display list of user in an ordered numbered list-like](./script8.sh)
- [Indicate types of files passed as arguments and for the current directory](./script9.sh)
- [Square-cube of number based on conditions](./script10.sh) 

If you have any issue with these scripts or questions about it, feel free to write in comments.

Thank you !

Hope more beginners scripts will be add to this repo.
